To get the audio signal for simulation:

1. Move the VDS_TEST_AUDIO_44_1_K.txt file within the Resources folder to your home directory "~/"
2. Set the transient simulation time to 40s, the audio signal is about 39.7s, but the simulation should automatically stop when it reaches the end of file.
3. Smaller length simulation can be done by reducing the transient simulation time to anywhere between 0-40s
4. The Resources folder also contains the original audio file in a .wav format (you can listen to the audio signal input using this file)
